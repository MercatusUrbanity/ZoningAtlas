# ZoningAtlas
The National Zoning Atlas, originally conceived of by Dr. Sara Bronin and compiled using a methodology designed by Bronin, Aline Fader, Dr. Scott Markley, and Evan Derickson, measures restrictions on residential construction. This repository shares data compiled by state teams funded in part by the Mercatus Center at GMU.
